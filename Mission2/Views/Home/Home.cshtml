<p><b>I hope to learn more about ASP.NET Core, especially considering the fact that I literally knew nothing before this class. Honestly, I'm not looking to be a programmer, but I hope this class will prepare me with the skills necessary to succeed in my future career. Seeing as this is my first exposure to a strongly-typed language, I hope to gain a better understanding and appreciation for this kind of programming.</b></p>
